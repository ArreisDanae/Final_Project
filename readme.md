This application showcases the net deforestation embedded in traded goods between countries. The data was collected in 2013 and is represented through a proportional symbol map. The objective for this application is to allow the user to easily view the 'deforestation footprint'ï»¿ discussed within the CarbonBrief article titled: 'Scientists calculate trade related deforestation footprint of rich countries'. The net deforestation is equal to each countries 'imported' deforestation subtracted from each countries 'exported' deforestation. Both the data and article are linked within the application.
